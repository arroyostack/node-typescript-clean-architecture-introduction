## Course Overview

This course is designed to help understand why Node is so popular on the backend and simultaneously widely used in almost all frontend frameworks as a tool to build applications.

We start with zero knowledge of Node but it's recommended to have some understanding of JavaScript and basic programming, as we assume familiarity with concepts like declaring variables, control structures like IF, and for loops.

Throughout the course, we'll build various applications ranging from console applications, webhook receivers, RESTful API endpoints, authentication, web sockets, and more. We'll be working with TypeScript and development patterns that help us write high-quality code.
